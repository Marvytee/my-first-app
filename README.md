5. JSX is in some ways almost like HTML, however, it does accompany certain conspicuous differences which we’ll cover within the next  section. Since JSX isn’t a legitimate JS code, it must be compiled into JS with a tool like Babel or similar.
Also, without wrapper element, JSX wont transpile.


6. Why browsers cant run JSX
Browsers cannot read JSX because there is no inherent implementation for the browser engines to read and understand it. You can use babel to transform your jsx into native javascript and HTML which browser can understand.
